Snake, Water, Gun Game
Description
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake, Water, Gun" game, which is a variation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. In this game, the player competes against the computer by choosing either Snake, Water, or Gun, and the winner is determined based on the following rules:

Snake drinks Water (Snake wins)
Water douses Gun (Water wins)
Gun kills Snake (Gun wins)
If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the game is a draw.

How to Play
The player inputs their choice of "s" for Snake, "w" for Water, or "g" for Gun.
The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
The choices are compared, and the winner is announced according to the rules above.
